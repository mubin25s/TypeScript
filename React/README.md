# React TypeScript Components

This directory contains common React components implemented with TypeScript.

## Components:

1.  **HelloWorld.tsx**: A simple functional component with basic styling.
2.  **Counter.tsx**: Demonstrates the `useState` hook for numeric state.
3.  **UserCard.tsx**: Shows how to use `interface` for defining component props.
4.  **TodoList.tsx**: A more complex component managing an array of objects in state.
5.  **PostList.tsx**: Demonstrates `useEffect` for data fetching with loading and error states.

## Getting Started

These components are written using Tailwind CSS classes for styling. Make sure you have Tailwind CSS configured in your project if you want the styles to appear correctly.

To use these components, simply import them into your main application file:

```tsx
import HelloWorld from './React/HelloWorld';
import Counter from './React/Counter';
```
